phase detector (pd aka phase comparator)
========================================
generates a voltage representing the phase difference of two signals.

---------
TODO how does it work?

types
-----

* digital phase detector
* phase frequency detector

TODO how their mechanisms differ

used in
-------
* phase-locked loop
* motor control

* telecom
* servo
* demodulator
